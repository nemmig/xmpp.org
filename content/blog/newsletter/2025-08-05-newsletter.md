Welcome to the XMPP Newsletter, great to have you here again!
This issue covers the month of July 2025.

Like this newsletter, many projects and their efforts in the XMPP community are a result of people’s voluntary work. If you are happy with the services and software you may be using, please consider saying thanks or helping these projects! Interested in supporting the Newsletter team?

## XSF Announcements

### XMPP at FrOSCon 20

On August 16th & 17th, 2025, the [FrOSCon](https://froscon.org/en/) will hold its 20th anniversary edition™. It will take place at the Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg in Sankt Augustin, Germany, and the XMPP community will be part of it!

While you are there, you may be interested in what is going on at the [Devrooms](https://froscon.org/en/program/project-rooms/).

The **Gemeinsamer DevRoom von Gentoo e.V. und TroLUG** will take place at **Room C125**, where [Gentoo e.V.](https://fosstodon.org/@Gentoo_eV) and [TroLUG](https://fosstodon.org/@TroLUG) will offer a rich and varied 2-day program on various topics, including the [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/) and [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) distributions and free software for smartphones. **XMPP will play a special role**. Short presentations, [demos](https://blog.dohdom.de/elektronik-projekte) and workshops will encourage visitors to join in. There will also be plenty of time for spontaneous topics and social interaction. (Shh! Don't tell anyone! ... but you can take a look at all the nitty gritty details in [here](https://trolug.pads.ccc.de/2025-07?))

And, of course: make sure to come by the [XMPP booth](https://froscon.org/en/program/exhibitors/) and say hi!. We promise there will be stickers. ;)

It’s this cool project that helps make sure different XMPP servers can all work together smoothly. They have just released version 1.6.0 of all their test runners! The biggest chunk of work has gone into tests that verify parts of the basic XMPP protocol, notably for testing functionality that involves roster management (as specified in [section 2 of RFC 6121](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6121#autoid-7)) and for server rules for processing XML stanzas ([section 8 of RFC 6121](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6121#autoid-103)).

## Extensions and specifications

The XMPP Standards Foundation develops extensions to XMPP in its [XEP series](/extensions/) in addition to [XMPP RFCs](/rfcs/). Developers and other standards experts from around the world collaborate on these extensions, developing new specifications for emerging practices, and refining existing ways of doing things. Proposed by anybody, the particularly successful ones end up as Final or Active - depending on their type - while others are carefully archived as Deferred. This life cycle is described in [XEP-0001](/extensions/xep-0001.html), which contains the formal and canonical definitions for the types, states, and processes. [Read more about the standards process](/about/standards-process.html). Communication around Standards and Extensions happens in the [Standards Mailing List](https://mail.jabber.org/postorius/lists/standards.xmpp.org/) ([online archive](https://mail.jabber.org/hyperkitty/list/standards@xmpp.org/)).

### Proposed

The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the [XMPP Editor](/about/xsf/editor-team/). Within two weeks, the [Council](/about/xmpp-standards-foundation/#council) decides whether to accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

- No XEPs proposed this month.
  
### New

- Version 0.1.0 of [XEP-0504](/extensions/xep-0504.html) (Data Policy)
  - Accepted as Experimental by Council vote on 2025-06-08 (XEP Editor: dg)
- Version 0.1.0 of [XEP-0505](/extensions/xep-0505.html) (Data Forms File Input Element)
  - Accepted as Experimental by Council vote on 2025-07-08 (XEP Editor: dg)
 
### Deferred

If an experimental XEP is not updated for more than twelve months, it will be moved off Experimental to Deferred. If there is another update, it will put the XEP back onto Experimental.

- No XEPs deferred this month.

### Updated

- Version 1.10.0 of [XEP-0080](/extensions/xep-0080.html) (User Location)
  - Added `<regioncode/>` element. (jp)
- Version 1.2.0 of [XEP-0363](/extensions/xep-0363.html) (HTTP File Upload)
  - Add optional upload purpose when requesting slots (dg)

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the [Council](/about/xmpp-standards-foundation/#council) decides whether the XEP seems ready, the [XMPP Editor](/about/xsf/editor-team/) issues a Last Call for comments. The feedback gathered during the Last Call can help improve the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Stable.

- No Last Call this month.

### Stable

- No XEPs moved to Stable this month.

### Deprecated

- No XEPs deprecated this month.

### Rejected

- No XEPs rejected this month.

## Help us to build the newsletter

This XMPP Newsletter is produced collaboratively by the XMPP community. Each month's newsletter issue is drafted in this [simple pad](https://pad.nixnet.services/oHnY_ZvLT8SoFyCqIC2ung). At the end of each month, the pad's content is merged into the [XSF GitHub repository](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/milestone/3). We are always happy to welcome contributors. Do not hesitate to join the discussion in our [Comm-Team group chat (MUC)](xmpp:commteam@muc.xmpp.org?join) and thereby help us sustain this as a community effort. You have a project and want to spread the news? Please consider sharing your news or events here, and promote it to a large audience.

Tasks we do on a regular basis:

- gathering news in the XMPP universe
- *short* summaries of news and events
- summary of the monthly communication on extensions (XEPs)
- review of the newsletter draft
- preparation of media images
- translations
- communication via media accounts
